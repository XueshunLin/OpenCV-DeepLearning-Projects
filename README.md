## Overview

This repository is an in-depth exploration of a public market sales data. The `main.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook used for various data analysis and data science tasks.

## Contents

- `Dataset.zip/` - Contains the datasets used in this project.
  - `grouped_data.csv` - Contains grouped data according to the store type
  - `offline_data.csv` - Offline sales data.
  - `original_transaction_data.csv` - The raw transaction data.
- `main.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook
- `README.md` - This file.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required for this project.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Data normalization and standardization.
- Encoding categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify trends and patterns in the sales data. This includes:
- Sales trends over time.
- Regional sales performance.
- Product-wise sales analysis.
- Customer segmentation.

## Data Science
In addition to the insights derived from the exploratory data analysis and model comparisons, the project also includes forecasting the total sales for both online and offline channels. This involves:
- Time series analysis and forecasting techniques.
- Evaluation of forecasting models to predict future sales trends.
